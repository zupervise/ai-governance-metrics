## 🧠 What is this?

**AI Governance Metrics** is an open-source repository of actionable, defensible, and domain-specific metrics to assess the governance of AI systems.


Built for:
- ✅ Compliance & risk teams
- 📊 Data scientists building dashboards
- 🏛️ Policymakers and auditors
- 🧪 Researchers and enterprise innovation leads

## 🎯 Why this matters

AI governance often lacks *quantifiable* signals. This project aims to:

- Standardise **metrics that matter** across domains (e.g. pharma, finance, public sector)
- Link metrics to **real-world outcomes** like cost savings, risk reduction, and regulatory alignment
- Support **audit-readiness, explainability, and oversight**
